I should have known
from the start
If there would be a day
where things would change, babe
It's just I gave you my heart
Thinking you would stay
but you walk away
It didn't have to be confusing
You said you needed
a lil' bit more space
Instead you went with him
The least you coulda do is
say it to my face, baby
I'm not saying that you lie, but
Don't be wasting my time
Confusing me like
we'd get back together
And think you,
were my ride or die, but
Leave me for a new guy
I guess that I was wrong
about forever
Callin' but you hit decline
Only time will tell
if you're someone else
(heh)
It's just I gave you my time
But you closed the book
and put it on the shelf
It didn't have to be confusing
You said you needed
a lil' bit more space
Instead you went with him
The least you coulda
do is say it to my face, baby
I'm not saying that you lie, but
Don't be wasting my time
Confusing me like we'd get
back together
And think you,
were my ride or die, but
Leave me for a new guy
I guess that I was wrong
about forever
I'm not saying that you lie
(I ain't saying that you lie)
but
Don't be wasting my time
(Don't be wasting my time, baby)
Confusing me like we'd get back
together
(Confusing me like
we'd get back together)
Think you, were my ride or die
(said you were my ride or die)
but
Leave me for a new guy
(leave me for a new guy)
I guess that I was wrong
about forever
